The most interesting topic would be learning how to build PRS.
I may want to explore the PRS of other charateristics other than height.
Honestly speaking, there is not a potential change I can make, since Biomedical data science is brand new to me and we just began to learn eQTL analysis, and thus all I can do is to follow instructions (to avoid any mistakes).
I want to practically use the remote server to speed up the computation, since all I did this quarter was using local notebooks.
