**Question 1:** What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
   The most interesting topic would be learning how to build PRS.
**Question 2:** Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
   I may want to explore the PRS of other charateristics other than height.
**Question 3:** What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
   Honestly speaking, there is not a potential change I can make, since Biomedical data science is brand new to me and we just began to learn eQTL analysis, and thus all I can do is to follow instructions (to avoid any mistakes).
**Question 4:** What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
   I want to practically use the remote server to speed up the computation, since all I did this quarter was using local notebooks.
